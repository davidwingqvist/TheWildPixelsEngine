				-----------Documentation of Multithreading class-----------

				1. This class at the time being is best used with pooling.
				What is pooling? Pooling means that 1 or more threads are constantly
				running in the background and waiting for commands.

				------Pooling------
				To start initialize pooling simple call upon MultiThreader::Init(x, y);
				x - the amount of threads you want in the pool, this is recommended
				to use the "availableCores" integer since it scans the computer and
				returns the amount of available threads - 1 since the main thread
				needs a free core.
				y - the type of pooling, I recommend using the ThreadType::FIFO(First In First Out).

				Defines are created for ease of use with multithreading. If you plan on
				using threads on a function simple call THREAD_JOB or equivalent,
				input THREAD_JOB(the class name, the class function) inside the specified class.
				Some defines will check if any threads are active/free to use and
				either queue up the function or run it on the main thread depending on the situation.

				Before closing down the application please remember to call the Destroy() function.
				This will delete any allocated memory and handle any rogue threads still running.
